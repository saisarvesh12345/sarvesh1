In this task, we built a house price prediction model using linear regression. We started by loading a real-world dataset and performing data preprocessing — including converting categorical values (like “yes” or “no”) into numerical format and creating dummy variables for multiple categories. We then split the dataset into training and testing sets.

We trained a Linear Regression model using the training data and evaluated its performance on the test data using key metrics such as R² Score, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error. These metrics helped us understand how well the model predicted house prices. We also visualized the regression line for one of the independent variables to understand the trend.

Overall, this task helped us understand the end-to-end process of applying a machine learning model: from data cleaning to model training and evaluation — a fundamental step in developing any predictive analytics solution
